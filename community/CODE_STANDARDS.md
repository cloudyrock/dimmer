##### Tests

- Any code delivered should be covered by unit and integration tests.

- Unit test files should end with the sufix `UTest` and integration tests with `ITest`.

- We use the shouldXXX_whenXXX_ifXXXXX for test names. Something like shouldReturn4_whenSum_ifParametersAre2And2()

- Ensure the test coverage fits the threshold
